The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected specificity calculation doesn't occur as anticipated, leading to unexpected styling overrides.

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

#parent .child {
  color: red; /* Expected to override .parent due to ID specificity */
}

.parent .child {
  color: green; /* This unexpectedly overrides #parent .child */
}
```

The expected behavior is for `#parent .child` (higher specificity) to override `.parent .child` and `.parent`. However, due to a subtle error related to how some browsers (especially older ones or those with quirks) handle the order of CSS rules and specificity calculations, the last rule (`color: green;`) may take precedence.
